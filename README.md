# eye_cancer_classifier

In order to analyse if you have a disease you need to install some libraries :
- pip install flask
- pip install pillow
etc ...

(You need to install all the libraries in the file requirement.txt)

How use our solution ?

First you need to upload a png file (png of your eye) with the button upload on the application.
Once you did that, you need to click on the button 'Analyze your eye' to see if you have a disease and which one.

Now you can see if a have a disease or not and which one !

IMPORTANT : if you want to run locally, you need to run the app_flask_local.py
